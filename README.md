# This is an HTML parser for use in the Online Learning Center at NMSU Alamogordo.
# While this can be used for anything you need, it will really only work on Canvas pages through the Design Plus editor.

# I do not own the libraries used. This is just a personal tool for our office.

# To Use:
1) On the Canvas page, click edit
2) Click switch to RAW HTML Editor
3) Select inside of the textbox and press CTRL + A then CTRL + C
4) Switch to the HTML Parser and click "Format Clipboard Contents"
5) Switch back to the Canvas page and press CTRL + A then CTRL + V

# That should be the only thing you need to do. The other functionality in the app
# is entirely for my own debugging use, or if you needed to see what the code was doing

# Work in progress is for if I eventually spend the time to figure out how to scrape the
# Webpage and do it all manually
