# NMSU Alamogordo HTML Parser

This is a personal tool developed for use in the Online Learning Center at **NMSU Alamogordo**.  
While it can be used elsewhere, it’s specifically designed to work with **Canvas pages** edited via the **Design Plus** editor.

> **Note:** I do not own the libraries used—this is purely a utility for our office.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the Canvas page and click **Edit**.
2. Switch to the **RAW HTML Editor**.
3. Click inside the textbox and press `CTRL + A`, then `CTRL + C`.
4. Open the HTML Parser and click **Format Clipboard Contents**.
5. Return to the Canvas page and press `CTRL + A`, then `CTRL + V`.

That’s it! The rest of the app’s functionality is mainly for my own debugging or for inspecting the code behavior.

## 🛠️ Work in Progress

Eventually, I’d like to implement full webpage scraping so the parser can operate without manual copy-paste steps.

Feel free to fork or adapt this for your own use—but keep in mind it’s tailored for our workflow.
